<title>Rachel Kelly's No-Frills Resume</title>

<h1>Rachel Kelly</h1>
<h2><em>not, in fact, a front-end developer</em></h2>

<p>
I code in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have a zillion years of customer service experience which has 
dovetailed gorgeously into the last few years of technically demanding 
support.
</p>

<p>
I'm comfortable with the Unix command line as well as with git.  Check 
out my <a href="http://www.github.com/rachelkelly">github</a> if you're 
so inclined.
</p>

<p>
I've also kept a process blog on a lil' Wordpress guy I set up in 
September 2013.  See that... <a

</p>

<p>
I live and work in beautiful Portland, Oregon.  If you do too and you 
are looking for an experienced, technically capable addition to your 
support team, or for a junior dev to hire and to STAY with your company, 
get at me!  rachel at therachelkelly dot-com!  just.. not for front-end. 
:)
